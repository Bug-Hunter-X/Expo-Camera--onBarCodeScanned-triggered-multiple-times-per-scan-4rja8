This bug occurs when using Expo's `Camera` component with a custom `onBarCodeScanned` function.  The function is called multiple times for a single barcode, leading to unexpected behavior and potentially causing performance issues. This is especially noticeable when scanning barcodes rapidly or in situations with low lighting where the scanner may struggle to quickly determine the scan result.  The issue is not consistently reproducible across all devices and Expo versions.
